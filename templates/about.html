    <h2> Welcome to LibrePol, a website designed to help you make change that matters.</h2>
    <p>Our mission is to bridge the gap between you and your government. We here at LibrePol are tired of local policy makers ignoring the needs and desires of the people, so we created LibrePol to help address this divide. At LibrePol, you can be vocal about the issues you care about. Make your voice heard on what should be addessed in your community! </p>
    <p>In the current internet landscape, it feels like privacy and convenience are two ends of a spectrum. With LibrePol, we aim to provide both. With a focus on simplicity and accesibility, we took measures to avoid common political pitfalls such as identity politics, virtue signaling, and ad hominem by opting to maintain complete user anonymity.</p>
    <p> While LibrePol is a completely anonymous posting system, the moderating team exercises a zero-tolerance policy on posts which threaten any individual or group. If you want to take down a post for any reason, you will need to personally reach out to our moderators, so post with intentionality.</p>
